Projects completed at different stages of School of Code.

Over the past 16 weeks of School of Code, I have been fortunate to learn a great deal. Please find enclosed some examples of projects and tasks that I have completed during this time, from early on, learning about JavaScript to later collaborative projects. Hopefully this will serve to show the progress that I have made during the bootcamp.
